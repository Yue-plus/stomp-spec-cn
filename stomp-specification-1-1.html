      <h1 id='stomp_protocol_specification_version_11'>Stomp Protocol Specification, Version 1.1</h1>

<p>The 1.1 version of the specification is still being developed. This is only draft document.</p>

<h2 id='stomp_frames'>Stomp Frames</h2>

<p>Stomp is designed to work best over a stream based communications transport like TCP. The client and server will communicate using &#8216;frames&#8217; sent over the stream. A frame&#8217;s structure looks like:</p>

<pre><code>command
header1:value1
header2:value2

Body^@</code></pre>

<p>The frame starts with a command string, followed by a newline, followed by header entries in <code>&lt;key&gt;</code>:<code>&lt;value&gt;</code> format. Each header entry is followed by a newline. A blank line indicates the end of the headers and beginning of the body. The body is then followed by null or <code>^@</code> (control-@ in ASCII) byte. The null byte can be optionally be followed by multiple newlines. For more details, on how to parse Stomp frames, see the <a href='#augmented-bnf'>Augmented BNF</a> section of this document.</p>

<h3 id='repeated_header_entries'>Repeated Header Entries</h3>

<p>Since messaging systems can be organized in store and forward topologies, similar to SMTP, a message may traverse serval messaging servers before reaching a consumer. The intermediate server may &#8216;update&#8217; header values in the message by prepending headers to the message.</p>

<p>If the client receives repeated frame header entries, only the first header entry should be used as the value of header entry. Subsequent values are only use to maintain a history of state changes of the header. For example, if the client receives:</p>

<pre><code>MESSAGE
foo:World
foo:Hello

^@</code></pre>

<p>The value of the <code>foo</code> header is just <code>World</code>.</p>

<h2 id='connecting'>Connecting</h2>

<p>A Stomp client initiates the stream or TCP connection to the server. The client must then send the <code>CONNECT</code> frame.</p>

<pre><code>CONNECT
version: 1.1
host:stomp.github.org
          
^@</code></pre>

<p>If the server accepts the connection attempt it will respond with a <code>CONNECTED</code> frame:</p>

<pre><code>CONNECTED
version: 1.1

^@</code></pre>

<p>The sever may reject any connection attempt. The server SHOULD respond back with a ERROR frame listing why the connection was rejected and then the sever will close the connection. Since Stomp servers must support clients which rapidly connect and disconnect, a server will likely only allow closed connections to linger for short time before the connection is reset. This means that a client may not fully receive the ERROR frame before the socket is reset.</p>
<h3 id='frame-CONNECT'>CONNECT Frame</h3>
<p>Stomp 1.1 clients MUST set the following headers:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>version</code>: The versions of the Stomp protocol the client supports. See <a href='#protocol-negotiation'>Protocol Negotiation</a> for more details.</li>

<li><code>host</code>: The host name that the socket was established against. This allows the server to implement virtual hosts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stomp 1.1 clients MAY set the following headers</p>

<ul>
<li><code>login</code>: The user id used to authenticate against a secured Stomp server.</li>

<li><code>passcode</code>: The password used to authenticate against a secured Stomp server.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='future_compatibility'>Future Compatibility</h4>

<p>In future versions of the specification, the <code>CONNECT</code> frame will be renamed to <code>STOMP</code>. Stomp 1.1 servers should handle a <code>STOMP</code> frame the same way as the <code>CONNECT</code> frame. Stomp 1.1 clients should continue to use the <code>CONNECT</code> command to remain backward compatible with Stomp 1.0 servers.</p>

<p>The reason to frame is being renamed is so that the protocol can more easily be differentiated from the HTTP protocol by a protocol sniffer/discriminator.</p>
<h3 id='frame-CONNECTED'>CONNECTED Frame</h3>
<p>Stomp 1.1 servers MUST set the following headers:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>version</code>: The versions of the Stomp protocol the server supports. See <a href='#protocol-negotiation'>Protocol Negotiation</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stomp 1.1 servers MAY set the following headers</p>

<ul>
<li><code>session</code>: A session id that uniquely identifies the session.</li>
</ul>
<!--
TODO: is this the reasoning for the session id?
The client can use the session id as the base to generate globally unique identifies by appending a incrementing counter.
--><h2 id='protocol-negotiation'>Protocol Negotiation</h2>
<p>From Stomp 1.1 and onwards, the <code>CONNECT</code> and <code>CONNECTED</code> frames MUST include the <code>version</code> header. It should be set to a space separated list of incrementing Stomp protocol versions that the client or server support. If the version header is missing, it means that only version 1.0 of the protocol is supported.</p>

<p>The protocol that will be used for the reset of the session will be the highest protocol version that both the client and server have in common.</p>

<p>For example, if the client sends:</p>

<pre><code>CONNECT
version:1.0 1.1 2.0
host:stomp.github.org
          
^@</code></pre>

<p>and the server responds with:</p>

<pre><code>CONNECTED
version:1.1 2.1

^@</code></pre>

<p>Then the reset of the session should use version 1.1 of the protocol.</p>

<p>If the client and server do not share any common protocol versions, then the sever should respond with an ERROR frame that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR
version:1.1 2.1
          
Supported protocol versions are 1.1 2.1^@</code></pre>

<h2 id='once_connected'>Once Connected</h2>

<p>Once the client is connected it may send any of the following frames:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='#frame-SEND'>SEND</a></li>

<li><a href='#frame-SUBSCRIBE'>SUBSCRIBE</a></li>

<li><a href='#frame-UNSUBSCRIBE'>UNSUBSCRIBE</a></li>

<li><a href='#frame-BEGIN'>BEGIN</a></li>

<li><a href='#frame-COMMIT'>COMMIT</a></li>

<li><a href='#frame-ABORT'>ABORT</a></li>

<li><a href='#frame-ACK'>ACK</a></li>

<li><a href='#frame-DISCONNECT'>DISCONNECT</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id='client_frames'>Client Frames</h2>
<h3 id='frame-SEND'>SEND</h3>
<p>The SEND frame sends a message to a destination in the messaging system. It has one required header, <em>destination</em>, which indicates where to send the message. The body of the SEND frame is the message to be sent. For example:</p>

<pre><code>SEND
destination:/queue/a

hello queue a
^@</code></pre>

<p>This sends a message to the <em>/queue/a</em> destination. This name, by the way, is arbitrary, and despite seeming to indicate that the destination is a &#8220;queue&#8221; it does not, in fact, specify any such thing. Destination names are simply strings which are mapped to some form of destination on the server - how the server translates these is left to the server implementation. See <a href='http://activemq.apache.org/stomp.html'>this note on mapping destination strings to JMS Destinations</a> for more detail.</p>

<p>SEND supports a <em>transaction</em> header which allows for transaction sends.</p>

<p>It is recommended that SEND frames include a content-length header which is a byte count for the length of the message body. If a content-length header is included, this number of bytes should be read, regardless of whether or not there are null characters in the body. The frame still needs to be terminated with a null byte and if a content-length is not specified, the first null byte encountered signals the end of the frame.</p>
<h3 id='frame-SUBSCRIBE'>SUBSCRIBE</h3>
<p>The SUBSCRIBE frame is used to register to listen to a given destination. Like the SEND frame, the SUBSCRIBE frame requires a <em>destination</em> header indicating which destination to subscribe to. Any messages received on the subscription will henceforth be delivered as MESSAGE frames from the server to the client. The <em>ack</em> header is to control the message acknowledgement mode. The valid values for <em>ack</em> are <em>auto</em>, <em>client</em>, or <em>client-individual</em>. If the header is not set, it defaults to <em>auto</em>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>SUBSCRIBE
destination: /queue/foo
ack: client

^@</code></pre>

<p>The body of the SUBSCRIBE frame is ignored.</p>

<p>When the the <em>ack</em> mode is <em>auto</em>, then the client does not need to send the server ACK frames for the messages it receives. The server will assume the client has received the message as soon as it sends it to the the client. This acknowledgment mode cause cause messages being transmitted to the client to get dropped.</p>

<p>When the the <em>ack</em> mode is <em>client</em>, then the client must send the server ACK frames for the messages it processes. If the connection fails before a client ACKs the message the server will assume the message has not been processed and may redeliver the message to another client. The ACK frames sent by the client will be treated as a cumulative ACK. This means the ACK operates on the message specified in the ACK frame and all messages sent before the messages to the subscription.</p>

<p>When the the <em>ack</em> mode is <em>client-individual</em>, the ack mode operates just like the <em>client</em> ack mode except that the ACK frames sent by the client are not cumulative ACKs. This means that an ACK for a subsequent message should not cause a previous message to get acknowledged.</p>

<p>Stomp brokers may support the <em>selector</em> header which allows you to specify an <a href='http://activemq.apache.org/selectors.html'>SQL 92 selector</a> on the message headers which acts as a filter for content based routing.</p>

<p>You can also specify an <em>id</em> header which can then later on be used to UNSUBSCRIBE from the specific subscription as you may end up with overlapping subscriptions using selectors with the same destination. If an <em>id</em> header is supplied then Stomp brokers should append a <em>subscription</em> header to any MESSAGE frames which are sent to the client so that the client knows which subscription the message relates to. If using <a href='http://activemq.apache.org/wildcards.html'>Wildcards</a> and <a href='http://activemq.apache.org/selectors.html'>selectors</a> this can help clients figure out what subscription caused the message to be created.</p>
<h3 id='frame-UNSUBSCRIBE'>UNSUBSCRIBE</h3>
<p>The UNSUBSCRIBE frame is used to remove an existing subscription - to no longer receive messages from that destination. It requires either a <em>destination</em> header or an <em>id</em> header (if the previous SUBSCRIBE operation passed an id value). Example:</p>

<pre><code>UNSUBSCRIBE
destination: /queue/a

^@</code></pre>
<h3 id='frame-BEGIN'>BEGIN</h3>
<p>BEGIN is used to start a transaction. Transactions in this case apply to sending and acknowledging - any messages sent or acknowledged during a transaction will be handled atomically based on the transaction.</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN
transaction: &lt;transaction-identifier&gt;

^@</code></pre>

<p>The <em>transaction</em> header is required, and the transaction identifier will be used for SEND, COMMIT, ABORT, and ACK frames to bind them to the named transaction.</p>
<h3 id='frame-COMMIT'>COMMIT</h3>
<p>COMMIT is used to commit a transaction in progress.</p>

<pre><code>COMMIT
transaction: &lt;transaction-identifier&gt;

^@</code></pre>

<p>The <em>transaction</em> header is required, you must specify which transaction to commit!</p>
<h3 id='frame-ACK'>ACK</h3>
<p>ACK is used to acknowledge consumption of a message from a subscription using client acknowledgment. When a client has issued a SUBSCRIBE frame with the <em>ack</em> header set to <em>client</em> any messages received from that destination will not be considered to have been consumed (by the server) until the message has been acknowledged via an ACK.</p>

<p>ACK has one required header, <em>message-id</em>, which must contain a value matching the <em>message-id</em> for the MESSAGE being acknowledged. Additionally, a <em>transaction</em> header may be specified, indicating that the message acknowledgment should be part of the named transaction.</p>

<pre><code>ACK
message-id: &lt;message-identifier&gt;
transaction: &lt;transaction-identifier&gt;

^@</code></pre>

<p>The <em>transaction</em> header is optional.</p>
<h3 id='frame-ABORT'>ABORT</h3>
<p>ABORT is used to roll back a transaction in progress.</p>

<pre><code>ABORT
transaction: &lt;transaction-identifier&gt;

^@</code></pre>

<p>The <em>transaction</em> header is required, you must specify which transaction to abort!</p>
<h3 id='frame-DISCONNECT'>DISCONNECT</h3>
<p>DISCONNECT does a graceful disconnect from the server. It is quite polite to use this before closing the socket.</p>

<pre><code>DISCONNECT

^@</code></pre>

<h2 id='standard_headers'>Standard Headers</h2>

<p>Some headers may be used, and have special meaning, with most packets</p>
<h3 id='header-receipt'>Receipt</h3>
<p>Any client frame other than CONNECT may specify a <em>receipt</em> header with an arbitrary value. This will cause the server to acknowledge receipt of the frame with a RECEIPT frame which contains the value of this header as the value of the <em>receipt-id</em> header in the RECEIPT packet.</p>

<pre><code>SEND
destination:/queue/a
receipt:message-12345

Hello a!^@</code></pre>

<h2 id='server_frames'>Server Frames</h2>

<p>The server will, on occasion, send frames to the client (in additional to the initial CONNECTED frame). These frames may be one of:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='#frame-MESSAGE'>MESSAGE</a></li>

<li><a href='#frame-RECEIPT'>RECEIPT</a></li>

<li><a href='#frame-ERROR'>ERROR</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id='frame-MESSAGE'>MESSAGE</h3>
<p>MESSAGE frames are used to convey messages from subscriptions to the client. The MESSAGE frame will include a header, <em>destination</em>, indicating the destination the message was delivered to. It will also contain a <em>message-id</em> header with a unique identifier for that message. The frame body contains the contents of the message:</p>

<pre><code>MESSAGE
destination:/queue/a
message-id: &lt;message-identifier&gt;

hello queue a^@</code></pre>

<p>It is recommended that MESSAGE frames include a <em>content-length</em> header which is a byte count for the length of the message body. If a <em>content-length</em> header is included, this number of bytes should be read, regardless of whether or not there are null characters in the body. The frame still needs to be terminated with a null byte, and if a <em>content-length</em> is not specified the first null byte encountered signals the end of the frame.</p>
<h3 id='frame-RECEIPT'>RECEIPT</h3>
<p>Receipts are issued from the server when the client has requested a receipt for a given frame. A RECEIPT frame will include the header <em>receipt-id</em>, where the value is the value of the <em>receipt</em> header in the frame which this is a receipt for.</p>

<pre><code>RECEIPT
receipt-id:message-12345

^@</code></pre>

<p>The receipt body will be empty.</p>
<h3 id='frame-ERROR'>ERROR</h3>
<p>The server may send ERROR frames if something goes wrong. The error frame should contain a <em>message</em> header with a short description of the error, and the body may contain more detailed information (or may be empty).</p>

<pre><code>ERROR
message: malformed packet received

The message:
-----
MESSAGE
destined:/queue/a

Hello queue a!
-----
Did not contain a destination header, which is required 
for message propagation.
^@</code></pre>

<p>It is recommended that ERROR frames include a <em>content-length</em> header which is a byte count for the length of the message body. If a <em>content-length</em> header is included, this number of bytes should be read, regardless of whether or not there are null characters in the body. The frame still needs to be terminated with a null byte, and if a <em>content-length</em> is not specified the first null byte encountered signals the end of the frame.</p>
<h2 id='heart-beating'>Heart-beating</h2>
<p>Heart-beating can optionally be used to test the healthiness of the underlying TCP connection and to make sure that the remote end is alive and kicking.</p>

<p>In order to enable heart-beating, each party has to declare what it can do and what it would like the other party to do. This happens at the very beginning of the STOMP session, by adding a <code>heart-beat</code> header to the CONNECT and CONNECTED frames.</p>

<p>When used, the <code>heart-beat</code> header MUST contain two positive integers separated by a comma.</p>

<p>The first number represents what the sender of the frame can do (outgoing heart-beats):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>0 means it cannot send heart-beats</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>otherwise it is the smallest number of milliseconds between heart-beats that it can guarantee</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The second number represents what the sender of the frame would like to get (incoming heart-beats):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>0 means it does not want to receive heart-beats</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>otherwise it is the desired number of milliseconds between heart-beats</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>heart-beat</code> header is optional. A missing <code>heart-beat</code> header MUST be treated the same way as a &#8220;heart-beat:0,0&#8221; header, that is: the party cannot send and does not want to receive heart-beats.</p>

<p>The <code>heart-beat</code> header provides enough information so that each party can find out if heart-beats can be used, in which direction and with which frequency.</p>

<p>More formally, the initial frames look like:</p>

<pre><code>CONNECT
heart-beat:&lt;cx&gt;,&lt;cy&gt;

CONNECTED:
heart-beat:&lt;sx&gt;,&lt;sy&gt;</code></pre>

<p>For heart-beats from the client to the server:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>if <code>&lt;cx&gt;</code> is 0 (the client cannot send heart-beats) or <code>&lt;sy&gt;</code> is 0 (the server does not want to receive heart-beats) then there will be none</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>otherwise, there will be heart-beats every MAX(<code>&lt;cx&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;sy&gt;</code>) milliseconds</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In the other direction, <code>&lt;sx&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;cy&gt;</code> are used the same way.</p>

<p>Regarding the heart-beats themselves, any new data received over the network connection is an indication that the remote end is alive. In a given direction, if heart-beats are expected every <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> milliseconds:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>the sender MUST send new data over the network connection at least every <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> milliseconds</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>if the sender has no real STOMP frame to send, it MUST send a single newline byte (0x0A)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>if, inside a time window of at least <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> milliseconds, the receiver did not receive any new data, it CAN consider the connection as dead</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>because of timing inaccuracies, the receiver SHOULD be tolerant and take into account an error margin</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='augmented-bnf'>Augmented BNF</h2>
<p>We will use the augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) used in the HTTP/1.1 (rfc2616) to define a valid stomp frame:</p>

<pre><code>LF                  = &lt;US-ASCII LF, linefeed (octect 10)&gt;
CHAR                = &lt;any US-ASCII character (octets 0 - 127)&gt;
OCTET               = &lt;any 8-bit sequence of data&gt;
DIGIT               = &lt;any US-ASCII digit &quot;0&quot;..&quot;9&quot;&gt;
NULL                = &lt;octect 0&gt;

                      *( header LF )
                      LF
                      [ content ]
                      NULL
